        <h3>Week 1</h3>
        <p>Estrogen is at rock-bottom, so this week will start off slow and your energy and mood will rise throughout. Estrogen helps your brain produce feel-good chemicals, so most women experience a distinct surge in optimism this week.</p>
        <p><span class="physically">What's happening physically:</span> On day 1, the thickened lining of the uterus begins to shed, commonly called menstruation. This can last anywhere from 3 to 7 days.</p>
        <br>
        <hr>

        <h3>Week 2</h3>
        <p>Estrogen continues to rise until it reaches its peak at the end of week 2. Subsequently, your brain is prompted to produce even more feel-good chemicals. During this week, you're more prone to feeling upbeat, adventurous, and confident.</p>
        <p><span class="physically">What's happening physically:</span> An egg follicle on an ovary gets ready to release an egg. Typically, one egg is released per cycle. At the same time, the uterus begins to grow a new endometrium in preparation for pregnancy.</p>
        <br>
        <hr>

        <h3>Week 3</h3>
        <p>Week 3 begins the day after ovulation. Estrogen begins to drop dramatically, which can trigger the blues, frustration, and anxiety. Progesterone (a sedating hormone) begins to rise at the same time, causing you to feel mellow and even weepy. By
          the second half of the week, estrogen spikes again and, combined with rising progesterone, will offer you a gentle calming feeling.</p>
        <p><span class="physically">What's happening physically:</span> On ovulation day, an egg is released from the egg follicle on the ovary. If the egg is fertilized and attaches to the endometrium, a pregnancy begins.</p>
        <br>
        <hr>

        <h3>Week 4</h3>
        <p>Often the least favorite phase of the cycle, week 4 is your premenstrual week. Estrogen drops steadily, prompting mood swings, irritableness, pessimism, and weepiness. However, these moods are more likely to be intermittent rather than constant.</p>
        <p><span class="physically">What's happening physically:</span> If you haven't become pregnant, the endometrium will begin to break down, leading into the menstruation phase of your cycle.</p>
